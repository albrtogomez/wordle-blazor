<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Just another Wordle clone created with Blazor with the sole purpose of experimenting and learning.

### Built With

* [.NET 6](https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-6)
* [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Blazored LocalStorage](https://github.com/Blazored/LocalStorage)

### Javascript Free

My only rule from the beginning of this project is not to write a single line in Javascript. All features should be 100% Blazor.

### Playable Demo
